The dataset `modeldata.csv` includes the following baseline features used to predict deal value:

- **CPI**: Measures the perception of corruption in a country. Higher CPI values indicate less corruption, which is often associated with a more favorable investment environment.
- **Exports**: Represents the total value of goods and services sold abroad. A higher export value indicates a strong international trade presence, which can boost deal-making activities.
- **GDP**: The total value of goods and services produced in a country. A higher GDP reflects a larger economy, which can influence the volume and value of deals.
- **Per_Capita**: The GDP divided by the population. This measure helps understand the economic conditions on a per-person basis, influencing individual and business investment decisions.
- **FDI_net**: Net foreign direct investment. High levels of FDI suggest that foreign investors are interested in the countryâ€™s economic prospects, which can correlate with higher deal-making activities.
- **Inflation**: The rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising. Moderate inflation rates are generally preferred as high inflation can create uncertainty in investment decisions.
- **Political_Stability**: Indicates the likelihood of political unrest. Greater political stability can lead to a more predictable investment environment, encouraging deal-making.

These features have been selected because they offer a comprehensive view of the economic and political environment in a country, which are critical factors in determining deal-making activities.
